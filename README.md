If you work from home then it may make sense to have dedicated tablets (which can be cheaply obtained - nexus 10 tablets are very cheap) for food entry with a limited number of items. In my experience tools like myfitnesspal become *very* annoying to use over time.

The other motivation is to separate recording from calorie display. In theory you want to know calories when making decision. But it is in practice advantageous to smear the food decision making out over the day.
