# Unknowns
A key aspect of nutrition-pad is resolving unknown foods after the fact. This makes tracking possible.

This can be done from the commadn-line. Sometimes with the help of an llm using the command line tooosl.
As a rule - everytime i record an unknown I create a note telling me what I need to add. I can find the context with `nutrition-notes`. And then search the foods and possibly add one with `nutrtion-food`.

An LLM can do all of that.
