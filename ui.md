Every page should have a header.

The day should change over at 5am.

## Standard Header Icons

Every page should have the same 5 header icons in this order:

1. 🍎 Food Pads (`/`) - home, log food
2. 📏 Amounts (`/?pad=amounts`) - `fa-ruler` - set portion size
3. 🍴 Meal Build (`/meals/build`) - `fa-utensils` - create/add to meal
4. 📝 Notes (`/notes`) - `fa-sticky-note` - food notes
5. ⚙️ Settings (`/edit-foods`) - `fa-cog` - edit food config

Use Font Awesome icons (fas fa-*) for consistency.
